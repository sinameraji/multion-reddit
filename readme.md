# read me

using multion to find all the commenters under a given reddit post, and DMing a message to them.

## order of execution
1. create a .env file with MULTION_API_KEY, MESSAGE_TEMPLATE and POST_URL
2. run scrape.py to scrape reddit users
3. run dm.py to send dms to scraped users

## next iterations
* find trending posts that have certain keywords daily
* have agents that DM commentors and book calls or get them to sign up for a product
* slack notifications for me and my team when there's an opportunity to participate in a high signal thread

## open to collab
submit a PR, lets make this better!
